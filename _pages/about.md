I am a Doctoral Fellow at the [Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I research information technology and security, with a focus on media manipulation, censorship, conflict, and civil society. Previously, I was a researcher with the [Technology and Social Change Project](https://shorensteincenter.org/programs/technology-social-change/) at Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center.

News
======
Earlier this year, I was an expert witness on a panel for the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics regarding foreign interference and threats to the integrity of democratic institutions, intellectual property and the Canadian state. Recording can be found [here](https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/ETHI/meeting-61/notice).

I also wrapped up a great presentation with colleagues at the Citizen Lab on mixed methods for studying the impact and motivations behind cyber attacks on civil society at the 2023 International Communication Association's annual conference in Toronto. More on this team's incredible work on digital transnational repression can be found [here](https://citizenlab.ca/2022/03/psychological-emotional-war-digital-transnational-repression-canada/).
