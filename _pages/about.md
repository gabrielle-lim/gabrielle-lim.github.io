I am a researcher with the [Technology and Social Change Project](https://shorensteincenter.org/programs/technology-social-change/) at Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center, as well as a Doctoral Fellow at the [Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I research information technology and security, with a focus on media manipulation, censorship, conflict, and civil society.
