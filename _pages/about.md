I am a researcher with the [Technology and Social Change Project](https://shorensteincenter.org/programs/technology-social-change/) at Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center, as well as an associate at the [Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I research information technology and security, with a focus on media manipulation, censorship, conflict, and civil society. Previously, I was a grantee of the Open Society Foundations, where my research focused on far-right extremism online. I also completed a fellowship through the Open Technology Fund's Information Controls Fellowship Program, where I studied the securitization of “fake news” and censorship.
