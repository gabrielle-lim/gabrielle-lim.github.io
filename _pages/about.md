-Hello.
-======
I am a researcher with the Technology and Social Change Project at Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center, as well as an associate at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. I research information technology and security, with a focus on media manipulation, censorship, surveillance, and civil society. Previously, I was a grantee of the Open Society Foundations, where my research focused on far-right extremism online. I also completed a fellowship through the Open Technology Fund's Information Controls Fellowship Program, where I studied the securitization of “fake news” and censorship. I received my Master of Global Affairs from the Munk School at the University of Toronto in 2018 and am an incoming PhD candidate at the University of Toronto’s Political Science department.
